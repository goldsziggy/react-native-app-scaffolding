# react-native-app-scaffolding

This scaffolding is to help lay the foundation for larger scalable react native applications, useing:

* React
* React-Native
* Redux
    * Duck Pattern
* Styled-Components
* JWT Middleware

The idea of this repo is to clone it down to your machine, and get started on development right away. With a good base and room to grow your application the right way without having to refactor or reorganize your file structure down the road.

## Global dependencies
1. run this command to install react-native cli tools `npm install -g react-native-cli`

## Development Setup

1. First clone the repository `https://github.com/Caryyon/react-native-app-scaffolding`
2. Change directories: `cd react-native-app-scaffolding`
3. Install Dependencies: `yarn install`
4. In one terminal window run `yarn start`
5. In another terminal window run `react-native run-ios` - this will bundle the app and open Xcode's simulator

- at this point the simulator should show the app!!!
