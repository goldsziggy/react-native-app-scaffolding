# react-native-app-scaffolding

This scaffolding is to help lay the foundation for larger scalable react native applications, useing:

* React
* React-Native
* Redux
    * Duck Pattern
* Styled-Components
* JWT Middleware

The idea of this repo is to clone it down to your machine, and get started on development right away. With a good base and room to grow your application the right way without having to refactor or reorganize your file structure down the road.
